# copper-ops-bundle-plane

`copper-ops-bundle-plane` is a JavaScript project for Automation. It turns develop a JavaScript command-oriented project for bundle scenarios with layout fixtures, stable geometry snapshots, and bounded memory input sets into a small local model with readable fixtures and a direct verification command.

## Reading Copper Ops Bundle Plane

Start with the README, then open `metadata/project.json` to check the constants behind the examples. After that, `fixtures/cases.csv` shows the compact path and `examples/extended_cases.csv` gives a wider look at the same rule.

## Purpose

This project keeps the domain idea close to the tests. That makes it useful as a reference implementation, a small experiment, or a starting point for a more specialized tool.

## Fixture Notes

The examples are meant to be readable before they are exhaustive. They cover enough variation to show how latency and risk can pull a decision below the threshold.

## Design Sketch

The project is organized around a compact model rather than a large framework. Inputs are scored, classified, and checked against golden fixtures. The constants live in code and are mirrored in metadata so documentation drift is easy to catch. The JavaScript version uses native modules and a small Node test path.

## What It Does

- Models dry-run output with deterministic scoring and explicit review decisions.
- Uses fixture data to keep file plans changes visible in code review.
- Includes extended examples for safety rails, including `surge` and `degraded`.
- Documents idempotent checks tradeoffs in `docs/operations.md`.
- Runs locally with a single verification command and no external credentials.

## Usage

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

This runs the language-level build or test path against the compact fixture set.

## Verification

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/audit.ps1
```

The audit command checks repository structure and README constraints before it delegates to the verifier.

## Files Worth Reading

- `src`: primary implementation
- `tests`: verification harness
- `fixtures`: compact golden scenarios
- `examples`: expanded scenario set
- `metadata`: project constants and verification metadata
- `docs`: operations and extension notes
- `scripts`: local verification and audit commands
- `package.json`: Node package scripts

## Next Directions

- Add malformed input fixtures so the failure path is as visible as the happy path.
- Split the scoring constants into a typed configuration object and validate it before use.
- Add a comparison mode that shows how decisions change when one signal is adjusted.
- Add one more automation fixture that focuses on a malformed or borderline input.

## Limits

The examples cover useful edges, not every edge. A larger version would add malformed-input tests, richer reports, and deeper domain parsers.

## Setup

The only required setup is the local JavaScript toolchain. After cloning, stay in the repo root so fixture paths resolve correctly.
